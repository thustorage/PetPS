# build-local.sh - runs a Docker container from a Docker image with environment
#                  prepared for building PMDK project and starts building PMDK
#
# this script is for building PMDK locally (not on Travis)
#
# Notes:
# - run this script from its location or set the variable 'HOST_WORKDIR' to
#   where the root of the PMDK project is on the host machine,
# - set variables 'OS' and 'OS_VER' properly to a system you want to build PMDK
#   on (for proper values take a look on the list of Dockerfiles at the
#   utils/docker/images directory), eg. OS=ubuntu, OS_VER=16.04.
# - set 'KEEP_TEST_CONFIG' variable to 1 if you do not want the tests to be
#   reconfigured (your current test configuration will be preserved and used)
# - tests with Device Dax are not supported by pcheck yet, so do not provide
#   these devices in your configuration
